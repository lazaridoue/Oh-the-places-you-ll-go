### ❗ User Instructions
In the program, you are using a map to pin different locations. At first when you run the code the program pins five locations from a specific file, which are important to me. Then the user can add placed by clicking on the map. Then a screen opens with 3 questions, asking for the user’s name, the name of the chosen location as well as the preferred color of the pin. Then the program places a pin at the location where the user clicked. There is an Easter egg which is hidden at a place where we all know, when the Easter Egg is found, a message box lets you know and a star pin is being placed at the location.

### ❗ Errors
•	Places pins from one specific file

•	Color of the pin is not getting checked

•	If the color that the user chose is not recognized the program places a turtle stamp on the origin.

### ❗ Reflection
The main reason I chose this specific project was, it was one of the only two choices I had. At first, I did not enjoy this project at all, and I was ready to give up. I thought that doing the other choice would be more interesting, but I knew that the code was a complete mess and I did not have enough time to structure it. Therefore, I was left with only one choice. I started by doing something much more difficult than what I needed to, and I was constantly getting lost in between the code until I asked for help from Emily. 

At the beginning of the project, I did not understand the code of this teamwork and how a class would be useful in the program. Then I started by breaking it into small pieces and the work to build my class and functions. This was easy to happen after I understood the details of the code. Then, I started working on a screen in which it will be getting the answers from the user, by using Tkinter. I did not have any experience with it. Therefore, I went to a board and started following the code of an old Teamwork T14. In one evening, I had my Tkinter class ready. Then I faced to major problems. One that the labels on my Tkinter screen were not appearing and that I did not know how to get the data and sent is back again on the instance of the Place class. The second problem was easier to figure out because all I needed to do is relax and think about it clearly. So, during the weekend I was in Dana, and unexpectedly an idea came to my mind. Later on I went to try my new idea, and it finally worked. However, the labels were still not appearing. 

Even though labels seem to be the less interesting, they were the ones that made me struggle the most. Since I was facing that problem, I spent several hours at the Computer science lab as well as time after that with the TA’s and the professor to figure this out. Finally, Emily helped me to guide me and showing me what I was doing wrong. I learnt many different things from this project. First that I can do things even though I do not really like them. In addition, that many times I might find something difficult but I should not give up. If I could do something differently, I would definitely use my time more wisely and worked with Emily and the TAs as soon as I had any question or concern, not wait until the last moment. Lastly, I would look at the documentation of TkInter more closely and maybe I could have figured the issue out without panicking. 


### ❗ References
I read about the messege box online on the python documentation.
The class Place and the functions parse_file and extract_place are partly given from the project and they are not my own work.
For the TkInter class I followed closely Teamwork 14 
I would like to thank the TA's of the class and Dr. Lovell for the patience and their valuable help on this project.
